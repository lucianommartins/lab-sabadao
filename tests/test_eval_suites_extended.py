"""Unit tests for the 7 new native evaluation suites in gbench.

The sample loaders pull their datasets from HF Hub. That download is not
exercised here, for the reason given at the top of .github/workflows/test.yml:
these tests never contact an external service, so the suite stays
deterministic and safe to require for merge. `datasets.load_dataset` is
patched with fixed rows instead, which lets each loader's own transformation
be asserted directly rather than only its row count.
