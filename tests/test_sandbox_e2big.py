"""Regression: code-exec suites must feed a large program/harness on STDIN (`python -`), not as a
`-c <script>` argument. WS10 audit: LCB functional inputs (>100KB, embedded via {inp!r}/{args!r})
and the codeforces checker driver (embeds the input twice) exceeded Linux MAX_ARG_STRLEN (128KB),
raising OSError('Argument list too long') that `except Exception: return False` silently scored as a
wrong answer -> correct solutions marked failed (lcb 33%->67%, codeforces 67%->100%)."""
