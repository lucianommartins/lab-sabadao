"""Regression: omnidocbench text normalization must keep a markdown link's display text, not delete
the whole link. WS10 audit: deleting `[text](url)` was ASYMMETRIC - a model rendering a bare URL as a
markdown link (`[http://x](http://x)`) lost the URL from the prediction while the gold's bare URL was
kept, inflating the edit distance (0.083 -> 0.218) and flipping a faithful page from PASS to FAIL."""
