"""swebench error classification: a patch that would not apply is a MODEL failure (unresolved/0),
NOT an infrastructure failure. Only a true harness error (docker/build/timeout, or a missing log we
cannot inspect) is unscoreable. Regression for the WS10 finding where all 3 SWE-bench-Live instances
failed to apply (bad model diffs) and the run was mislabeled `status: error` instead of 0% resolved."""
