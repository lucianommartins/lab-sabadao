"""Regression: the per-eval result print must not crash on a present-but-None accuracy.

WS10: omnidocbench returned accuracy=None (composite undefined for the sampled pages). The per-eval
result print did `f"{acc:.2f}%"`, raising "unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__".
Because that print runs at the MODEL level (outside the per-eval try/except), it aborted the whole
fast stream at omnidocbench and lost the 12 suites after it. `_fmt_accuracy_pct` degrades None/
non-numeric to "-" so the run continues."""
