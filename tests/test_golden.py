"""Unit tests for the Golden Set benchmark runner.

These tests never touch a model. They stand up a fake in-process
OpenAI-compatible endpoint with scripted responses and assert that the
runner classifies each one correctly, so the suite stays deterministic
and green unless the runner logic itself breaks.

The highest-value test here is ``test_adversarial_responses_all_fail``.
The same fixture used to score 6/6 at 100% against the previous matcher
while returning factually inverted and actively unsafe content.
