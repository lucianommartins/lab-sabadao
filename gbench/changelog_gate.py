"""Enforcement for the Golden Set changelog rule.

The scaffold contract in :mod:`gbench.core.scaffold` makes a dataset
change *visible*, because the snapshot id moves. It does not make the
change *explained*. Six months later a reviewer looking at a score
discontinuity can see that `gd_661165ef` became `gd_9c1e04b2` and still
have no idea why, which is most of the way to no information at all.

So a change to a case must come with two things: a bump to
``meta.version``, and an appended ``meta.changelog`` entry saying why.
This module decides whether a diff satisfies that, and it is separate
from the CLI in ``scripts/check_golden_changelog.py`` so the rules can
be unit tested without a git repository.

Three properties are worth stating up front, because each one exists to
stop a specific way this kind of gate dies.

**The gate compares canonical content, not bytes.** It reads
:func:`gbench.canonical.canonical_json`, the same function the snapshot
hash reads. That is what makes the gate and the contract provably
consistent: if a change would not move the id, it does not trip the
gate. A gate that fires on reindentation gets switched off within a
month, and then it is enforcing nothing.

**The changelog itself is excluded from the comparison.** Without that
the rule is circular, because appending the entry that explains a bump
is itself a content change, which would demand another bump, which would
demand another entry. It also makes the initial backfill possible:
seeding a ``1.0`` entry onto all sixteen existing cases alters no case
content and so passes untouched.

**The changelog is append-only.** Existing entries may not be edited or
removed, so history cannot be quietly rewritten to make a past change
look like it never happened.

Deletions are reported rather than failed. There is no file left to
carry a changelog entry, so the rule is unenforceable by construction,
and a gate that cannot be satisfied is a gate people learn to override.

This module sits at the top of the package rather than under
``gbench.core`` because ``gbench/core/__init__.py`` imports the model
registry, which reaches Hugging Face at import time. The gate reads JSON
text out of a git diff and has no business touching the network, so it
takes nothing heavier than :mod:`gbench.canonical`.
