"""Cap OpenMP/BLAS threads inside SWE-bench execution containers.

Why this exists
---------------
The SWE harnesses create one container per instance and never set a thread
limit, so every numerical library inside sees the *host* core count. On this
box that is 96, and the harness is handed ``max_workers`` = the LLM request
concurrency (20), so a single scoring pass can ask for 20 x 96 = 1920 OpenMP
threads on 96 cores. The datasets in these unit tests are tiny, so essentially
all of that time goes into spawning and spin-waiting on threads.

Measured 2026-08-17, ``scikit-learn__scikit-learn-14710``, same image, same
unpatched source, same 4 CPUs, only the thread cap differing:

======================  ====================  ==================
``OMP_NUM_THREADS``     tests completed       wall clock
======================  ====================  ==================
``4``                   78 / 78 passed        6.28 s
unset (library sees 96) 34 / 78               killed at 541.53 s
======================  ====================  ==================

In the real run that instance had ~91 cores to itself and still did not finish:
it burned the harness's full 1800 s per-instance timeout and was scored as an
error. That single instance was 51% of the whole four-suite sweep. The failure
is ours, not the model's - the patch under test only touched
``_check_early_stopping_scorer``, which the stalled test never calls.

How it works
------------
``swebench`` creates each container with ``command="tail -f /dev/null"`` and
then ``exec_run``s the eval script. Docker applies the container's create-time
environment to exec'd processes (verified directly, including through the
``bash -lc`` login shell the eval script runs under), so setting the variables
at create time is enough - there is no need to touch the generated eval script.

The harnesses run as *subprocesses*, so a monkeypatch applied here would not
reach them. :func:`wrap_command` therefore re-launches the same target through
a small ``python -c`` bootstrap that calls :func:`install` first. The bootstrap
is fail-soft: if the shim cannot be imported or applied, the harness still runs
exactly as it did before, uncapped.
