"""Shared answer-extraction helpers (audit CC7).

Several suites decided correctness by scanning the whole response for a token: the first
option letter, a bare "yes" anywhere, the last number. Those read the model's *reasoning*
rather than its *answer*, so a response that argues its way to the right conclusion can be
scored wrong and vice-versa.

The rule implemented here: prefer an explicitly anchored answer ("Answer:", "Final
Answer:", \\boxed{}), fall back to the LAST candidate (the conclusion, not the first
thought), and refuse to guess when the response asserts both or neither.
