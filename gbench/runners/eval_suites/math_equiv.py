"""Symbolic/numeric answer equivalence for competition-math suites.

Suites like hmmt graded answers with regex string-normalization, so ``1/2`` != ``0.5`` and
``\\frac{\\sqrt2}{2}`` != ``\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}`` were scored wrong even when correct. The
canonical graders (HMMT/AIME leaderboards, OpenR1/lighteval) use symbolic equivalence.

``math_equivalent`` layers three checks, most authoritative first:
  1. `math_verify` (HuggingFace) parse+verify - extracts the answer from the full model
     response (it looks for ``\\boxed{}``/``$...$``) and checks LaTeX-aware equivalence;
  2. a `sympy` fallback (via ``latex2sympy2_extended`` when present, else ``sympify``) that
     catches equivalences math_verify's verify is conservative about (radical fractions,
     symbolic-vs-numeric like ``2\\pi`` == ``6.2831853``);
  3. normalized-string equality.

``math_verify``/``latex2sympy2_extended`` are optional extras. ``math_equivalent`` itself
degrades to sympy and then to string comparison when they are absent, but a math SUITE
should call :func:`require_backend_or_skip` and SKIP rather than publish a string-match
number as if it were symbolic equivalence (see ``available``).
