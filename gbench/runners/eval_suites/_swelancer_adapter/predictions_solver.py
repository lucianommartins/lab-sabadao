"""gbench predictions-scorer adapter for SWELancer (openai/SWELancer-Benchmark).

Upstream ships only `SimpleAgentSolver(model="gpt-4o")` (run_swelancer.py) - an agent that GENERATES
and scores in one loop, so there is no way to score patches produced by another model. This module
provides a `PredictionsSolver` that APPLIES a pre-generated unified-diff patch (from gbench's model)
into the task's container and then triggers SWELancer's OWN grading (the hidden Playwright pytest),
plus a `SWELancerPredictionsEval` that dumps per-issue results. gbench copies this file (and
run_swelancer_eval.py) into the SWELancer harness dir at run time and invokes it there.

Imports mirror swelancer_agent.py exactly (the nanoeval/alcatraz packages are vendored under the
harness's project/ and importable when run from the harness dir / uv env). It MUST be an importable
module, never __main__: nanoeval dill-serializes the whole EvalSpec (solver + eval) and asserts the
eval's module != "__main__".
