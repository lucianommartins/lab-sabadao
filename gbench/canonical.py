"""Canonical JSON, shared by the scaffold contract and the changelog gate.

This is a leaf module on purpose. It has no imports beyond the standard
library, and it deliberately sits outside ``gbench.core`` because that
package's ``__init__`` builds the whole model registry, which contacts
Hugging Face. The changelog gate runs in CI on a diff of JSON text files
and has nothing to do with models, so it must not pay that cost or take
that dependency. A policy gate that fails when Hugging Face is slow is a
policy gate that gets marked non-required.

The more important reason both callers read this one module: the gate
and the contract must agree on what counts as a change. The scaffold
snapshot hashes canonical form, so if the gate compared raw bytes it
would fire on reindentation that the hash ignores, and if it compared
something looser it would miss a change the hash caught. One function,
two callers, no drift possible.
