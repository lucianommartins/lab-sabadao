"""Scaffold and subject versioning for a benchmark run.

A benchmark number is only interpretable if two things held still: the
model, and the way we asked. If the prompt, the schema, the decode
settings, the scoring or the dataset moved between two runs, a score
change no longer tells you whether the model got better. It may only
tell you the question changed. So the harness gets versioned with the
same seriousness as the weights, and every result says which version
produced it.

Two axes, not one
-----------------
The fields that describe a run split into two kinds, and collapsing
them into a single id would break the most important comparison we
have.

* **Subject** is the thing under test: which checkpoint, at which
  quantization.
* **Scaffold** is how we asked: prompt, schema, scoring, tools,
  attempts, decode settings, dataset, the serving environment and the
  load shape.

The sweep is the scaffold, not a point in it
--------------------------------------------
A performance pillar does not run one measurement, it runs a sweep, and
``batch_sizes=[1, 32, 128, 256]`` is a property of the harness in
exactly the way the prompt is. So ``LOAD_SHAPE`` pins the sweep
*definition* rather than the individual point.

That distinction is what keeps the latency-versus-concurrency curve
legal. Every point on one curve shares a ``scaffold_id``, because they
came from one sweep, so plotting them as one line is correct by
construction. Today's b64 compares against last week's b64 whenever the
sweep and the environment held still. And editing ``--batch-sizes``
moves the id, which is also right, because a different sweep is a
different curve. Which point a given result file holds is already in its
name, so pinning per point would buy nothing and would forbid the plot.

Comparing quantization levels at a fixed harness is the whole point of
a compression sweep. A single combined hash would mark that comparison
illegal, because the quant is one of the inputs. Hashing the two axes
separately keeps it legal and still refuses the comparisons that are
genuinely meaningless:

===========================  ===========================================
what moved                   verdict
===========================  ===========================================
subject only                 Valid. This is the quant or model delta
scaffold only                New condition. Break the series, diff it
both                         Uninterpretable. Do not plot as one line
===========================  ===========================================

Honest coverage
---------------
Not every field is pinnable today. Rather than emit an id that
implies more rigour than exists, every block carries the ``covers`` set
it actually hashed and the ``unpinned`` remainder, and the id is
computed over exactly the covered fields. An id therefore cannot
over-promise by construction, and the UI can badge coverage next to the
number. ``unpinned`` is derived from :class:`ContractField` rather than
hand-maintained, because a hand-maintained list of what is missing is a
list that rots the first time someone adds a field.

A pillar we have not modelled yet emits a condition with an empty
``covers`` and a null ``scaffold_id``. That is deliberate. It says "this
ran and we pinned nothing about it", which is true, visible, and better
than silence.

Everything here is a real object with a single ``to_dict`` seam
---------------------------------------------------------------
The blocks below are dataclasses rather than free-form dicts, and each
one serialises through exactly one ``to_dict``. That is not decoration.
Three separate defects during bring-up were all the same shape: a value
that was not JSON-serialisable leaked into ``metadata.json`` and blew up
``json.dump`` at run start, before a single model had loaded. A typed
object with one serialisation seam turns that class of bug into a place
you can fix once.

    Every path that cannot pin anything returns an unmodelled scaffold
    rather than raising or omitting the condition. A pillar added to the
    enum with no builder yet therefore reports ``0/11`` and shows up in
    the table, which is the visible-gap behaviour the null scaffold
    exists for. Failing open to silence would be the one wrong answer.
