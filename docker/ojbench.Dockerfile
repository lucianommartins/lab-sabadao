# gbench-ojbench: isolated image for OJBench's online-judge scoring.
#
# OJBench judges a submission with the official `ojbench` library over the DMOJ sandbox
# (cptbox: ptrace + libseccomp syscall filtering), plus PyPy3 (Python-language solutions) and
# g++ (C++). DMOJ's cptbox does NOT build on Python 3.12 (its bundled Cython C accesses the
# PyLongObject.ob_digit field removed in 3.12), and the gbench serving env is 3.12 -- so the
# judge runs INSIDE this Python 3.11 image instead of the host venv. gbench does the model
# rollout itself (HTTP against the served model) and only hands the generated programs to this
# image for judging.
#
# Build (no build context needed beyond this docker/ dir, which holds the entrypoint):
#   docker build -t gbench-ojbench -f docker/ojbench.Dockerfile docker
#
# The 7.85 GB He-Ren/OJBench_testdata is NOT baked; it is bind-mounted read-only at run time.

# DMOJ judge-server from the EXACT commit OJBench's README pins. OJBench's judger.py calls
# `problem.cases()` (judger.py:135), an API that exists ONLY on this commit. The PyPI
# `dmoj==4.1.0` that `pip install -e OJBench` would otherwise pull has NO `Problem.cases()`, so
# every executable submission raises AttributeError inside the judge worker and NOTHING gets
# graded - the run silently reports 0% (measured 2026-09-11). On Python 3.11 dmoj's Cython C
# compiles fine (the ob_digit break is 3.12-only). Install this FIRST so it owns the dmoj slot.

# Fix ojbench's judge-loop deadlock: a worker that crashes hard mid-submission never queues a
# result, and the upstream unconditional result_queue.get() then hangs forever. The patch adds a
# bounded get + an all-workers-dead break (asserts it matched, so a future upstream change fails
# the build loudly rather than silently reintroducing the hang).
